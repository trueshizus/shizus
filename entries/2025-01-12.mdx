# Back from Invernation

Well, I have been some time out from writing here. Is time to bring it back. I managed to set up the accounts @shizus or @shizus.dev at Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, ENS, BlueSky and the domains .dev and .com.

I will start today by updating the version of NextJS used here.

First, let's run:

```bash
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
```

Running the upgrade...

Done!

I can already notice how the '--turbo' makes the autorefresh faster.

...And the day finished a few hours ago.
