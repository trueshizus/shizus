# Back from Invernation

Well, I have been some time out from writing here. Is time to bring it back. I managed to set up the accounts @shizus or @shizus.dev in Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, ENS, BlueSky and the domains .dev and .com.

I will start today by updating the version of NextJS used here.

First, let's run:

`npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`
