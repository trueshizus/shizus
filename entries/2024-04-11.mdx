# Back to business

And... we are back. It's been a few weeks since we stopped writing I want to keep this as a weekly hobby at least. I have not been writing in my notes either so it's time to get back.

Today I read a post on https://www.cmrg.me and it reminded me the of importance of writing. It shows how curiosity and creativity can be combined to create a compelling story.

I started working at a new job on the 2nd of April. I can notice how that slowed me down on some of my projects and I'm okay with that, at least for a few months.

I'm learning about Immutable, NextJS, created a repository with a friend to learn and practice dev ops skills I continue learning with frontend masters I'm going through my company's documentation and seeing how things are connected. I'm getting books about software engineering, I'm getting better at my craft and that makes me happy.

In the book Siddharta, the main character finds a man whose job is to drive a boat to cross a river. Almost ten years later, he needs to cross the river again and he finds the same guy, doing the same thing. I always looked with admiration to Siddharta for his quests for enlightenment but now I think I find the other guy more appealing. He found what he wanted to do in life. He helps people to cross the river. That's his job. That's his goal. So simple yet fulfilling.

That's how I want to be.
