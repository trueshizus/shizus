# Start again

When was the last time I went through the basics?

Last Friday, after pushing myself to pursue a job that I did not enjoy, I finally decided to listen to my body and accept no matter how much money I was making, or how important a company was: if I cannot see myself being there in the future, then I should not be there.

Now that I'm back to the pool of unemployed population I started practicing for coding interviews. And let's face it, I'm out of shape. Algorithms, System Design, Observability, Requirements, Management, Scrum, React, Typescript, Testing, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Promises, Responsive Designs, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Databases, ERDs, Problem-Solving, Analysis, Behavioral questions... The list is extensive.

When was the last time I read the React documentation? When was the last time I wrote a plain, simple, vanilla js app? I want to be up to date with the dev world, follow the trends, and stay on top of my game. But to build up, a strong foundation is necessary.

The steps to keep me on top are:

1. Learn.
2. Build.
3. Explain.

These three steps. Over and over again. Selecting a topic, understanding it, building a few prototypes, and explaining the how, the whys, and what's next.

There are a few additional steps to achieve mastery: deliberate practice, focus, and physical well-being. I've read a few books on self-improvement, learning, and habits. There are a few key insights that I gain from those:

1. Identity change: To become who you aspire to be, seeing yourself in that role, imagining what actions and routines that person has, and identifying those who you admire are key to developing long-lasting habits. Become what you want to be. Don't try to imagine yourself as a _I'm trying to_, instead see yourself as an _I am_.

2. Small daily changes: A big change will require a big effort. Focus on small but repetitive changes instead of radical modifications.

3. Find a mentor: When working on something new, it's easier to have the guidance of an expert.

4. Find a community: Making what you are trying to learn or achieve into a social event will allow you to keep yourself in that mindset.

5. Deliberate practice: pick a topic, focus on improving something, and measure.

I had a job interview two weeks ago. I was asked a basic question about React. I did not know the answer. I did not know the answer to a basic question. I've been using React for the last... 6 years. How come I cannot answer something basic? I was frustrated and the interview repeated in a loop for days. I will write in detail about the problem once the self-shame is gone, but I knew then and I know now that I have to reconnect with my craft and go back to the state of playful curiosity.

I have to look at my skills with a renewed lens and question the basics, go through the code, understand the building blocks and build more, put it out there, and share what I can do.

Putting in the effort, the discipline, the time.

I have to go back to the keyboard and start again.
