# Another Day

So, today i'm going to be focusing on the fonts, the layout just and setting some global configurations.

And also an update on the reading of the posts. Right now I just wanted to throw whatever I want to post into a folder called 'entries'. Each file in this folder is an '.mdx' file and the name is the date in which I started writing.

But there was a problem in the way I was loading the files. First, they were being displayed in A-Z and I wanted to be Z-A. For that I added a `.reverse()` at the end of the function that was grouping all files. But this had no effect on the order of the imports. So the files where still rendering as A-Z.

After doing some debugging I notice my error: I should not be using forEach to group promises. 

Before:

```typescript
const getPost = async () => {
  let post: JSX.Element[] = [];
  try {
    const files = fs
      .readdirSync(directoryPath)
      .filter((filename) => filename.endsWith(".mdx"));
    files.forEach(async (file) => {
      const { default: Component } = await import(`@/entries/${file}`);
      post.push(
        <article key={file}>
          <Component />
        </article>
      );
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Unable to scan directory: " + err);
  }

  return post;
};
```
and after:

```typescript
const getPost = async () => {
  let posts: JSX.Element[] = [];
  try {
    const files = fs
      .readdirSync(directoryPath)
      .filter((filename) => filename.endsWith(".mdx"));

    for (const file of files) {
      const { default: Component } = await import(`@/entries/${file}`);
      posts.push(
        <article key={file}>
          <Component />
        </article>
      );
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Unable to scan directory: " + err);
  }

  return posts.reverse();
};
```

And now it works. Lesson of the day: [Do not use forEach with async-await](https://gist.github.com/joeytwiddle/37d2085425c049629b80956d3c618971#file-async-await-foreach-alternatives-md)
