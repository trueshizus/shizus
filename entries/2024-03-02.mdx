# Outside

Well, it looks like the code highlighter is now working.

I started reading about NPM packages because I would like to publish one for the first time. I just had a quick look at the docs and they don't seem friendly to navigate. So maybe I will be documenting the steps for future reference.

I want to publish a Reddit Client that I've been using to track the mod queue. But today I have two events so I will not have that much time to spend in front of my computer.

Today I will be _outside_.
