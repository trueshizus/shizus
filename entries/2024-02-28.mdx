# Hello World

Using the mandatory name for the first post. The idea of publicly storing whatever I'm reading, learning, or testing has been on my head for a while.

Writing is what I do most and has been so far a tool for self-inspection. When I think about writing for an audience, my writing gets conditioned by the idea of perception.

How is this going to be seen by a stranger? How is it going to be seen by my friends, by my family, by my colleagues?

It's time to mature and accept that sometimes I'll get negative feedback for what I put out there. If you are not willing to accept that criticism, if the solution to avoid confrontation is to hide, then I'm guiding myself through an imaginary failure. Which is in itself a worse kind of failure than a real one.

In the upcoming days, I would like to start working on a few projects that I had in mind.

1. Reddit Moderation tool.
2. A Exercise Log Tracker.
3. An audiobook player.
4. To catch up on vanilla js.
5. Get familiar with Vercel, Supabase, and Fly.
6. Read and learn more about Software Engineering.
7. Explain Frameworks, Languages, and Tooling and make content more accessible.

So this is how this project currently looks like:

I think the best we can do is to check for some sources of inspiration.

[This one](https://github.com/marcantondahmen/automad-terminal?tab=readme-ov-file) looks nice
