# What's going on

I've been traveling and not keeping this site up to date. But I've been consistently programming, learning, writing, documenting and logging.

I've been working on a few things:

- I've been playing around with [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).
- I've been playing around with [Encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore).
- [Architectural Flow](https://github.com/trueshizus/architectural-flow): A diagraming tool inspired on Encore diagrams.
- [Basquade](https://github.com/frannoriega/basquade): A library to upload PDFs, train a model and answer questions.
- A private project that interacts with Inmmutable X.
- A [Reddit Moderation Tool](https://github.com/trueshizus/reddit-api-client) using bun workspaces.
- A competition on [Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/competition).
- I've been making useful contributions at my current job.

On the personal side, I've socializing, doing improv, reading and learning about math, physics, and programming.

A lot is going on in the frontend world:

- React compiler.
- CSS units, CSS color-mix, front control, margin box.
- Caching, AI tools, new environments.
