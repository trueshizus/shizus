# King's Night

Today is a celebration night in The Netherlands. I was not aware this was a thing until yesterday, when I checked Ticketswap to get tickets for a comedy show and I saw promotions for King's Night tickets.

But keeping those goals of getting better at this thing I took as my profession, I'm staying home tonight.

A lot is happening in the dev world:

- React 19 was announced.
- LLVM's are becoming open source (Meta and Apple released one recently).
- Seems like setting your own server is back.
- Typescript V5.
- Ruby on Rails is updating their docs.
- Bun for Windows (I'm testing that in a little bit).
- Zod for everything.


And I've also started working on a few things on my own:

- Migrated the Reddit API Client to Bun (just because).
- Started working on a library to upload PDFs, train a model and answer questions.
- I'm learning about optimization and performance improvement.
- I'm writing what I've learned in a repo called "Learning Center".
- I've been playing a bit with ImmutableJs.
- And trying to make useful contributions at my current job.


I need to make the lists in this blog look better.
