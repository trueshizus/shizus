# Model Basics


I've been using and interacting with AI models since they first appeared. They gave me a glimpse into what can be created with computers, reminding me of those early years when I was a kid and saw a computer for the first time. I saw magic in it. Now, I want to understand how the trick is done.

I do not have formal training on AI but I have some basic knowledge of programming and linear algebra. So, let's start by building the fundations of a language model.

I want to create a function that given a model and a string, returns a word. The most likely word to come up after the word I sent.

```ts 
const result = predict(model, 'Hello')
console.log(result)
```
Should print: 
```bash
world!
```

This could be represented as the following:


$$\left[ result \right] = \left[ model \right]\left[ input \right]$$

Where `result`, `model` and `input` are matrices.
