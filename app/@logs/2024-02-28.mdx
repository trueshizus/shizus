# Hello World

Using the mandatory name for a first post. The idea of publicly storing whatever i'm reading, learning, or testing has been on my head for a while.

Writing is what I do most and has been so far a tool for self inspection. When I think about writing for an audience, my writing gets conditioned by the idea of perception.

How is this going to be seen by an stranger? How is it going to be seen by my friends, by my family, by my colegues?

It's time to mature and accept that sometimes I'll get negative feedback for what I put out there. If you are not willing to accept that criticism, if the solution to avoid confrontation is to hide, then I'm guiding myself trough an imaginary failure. Wich is on itself a worst kind of failure than a real one.

In the upcoming days I would like to start working on a few projects that I had in mind.

1) Reddit Moderation tool.
2) A Excersice Log Tracker.
3) An audiobook player.
4) To catch up on vanilla js.
5) Get familiar with Vercel, Supabase and Fly.
6) Read an learn more about Software Engineering.
7) Explain Frameworks, Languages, Tooling and make content more accesible.

So this is how this project currently looks like:
