# From Belgium

Today I'm visiting Belgium with Vinicius. During the Bus ride I started reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Marting Klepman.

I've been thinking about making a summary of each chapter and posting it here. I think it would be a good way to keep track of what I'm learning and also to help me remember the concepts.

Would make some good videos for YouTube.

I've been playing around with Docusaurus and Hono. Both look promising.
